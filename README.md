# Java-BankApp_basic_OOP_training

I have created basic project for learning OOP principles in Java language. It is a simple BankApp where are 3 different type of accounts that can be created, each account has own menu, 
it means set of task.
**Customer** can withdraw, deposit, transfer,log out.
**Employee** can see detail of inputed bankaccount, log out.
**Admin** can delete account, see all accounts at once,log out.

I attached PDF file were i show all different possibilities within the programm.
